Here is all you need to know about relative file paths:

Starting with “/” returns to the root directory and starts there
Starting with “../” moves one directory backwards and starts there
Starting with “../../” moves two directories backwards and starts there (and so on…)
To move forward, just start with the first subdirectory and keep moving forward
